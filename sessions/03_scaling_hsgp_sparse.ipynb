    "# Session 3: Scaling with HSGP and Sparse Methods\n",

    "**Duration:** 2–3 hours\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this session, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the computational bottlenecks of standard Gaussian processes\n",
    "- Apply inducing point methods and sparse approximations to scale GPs to larger datasets\n",
    "- Implement Hilbert Space GP (HSGP) approximations in PyMC\n",
    "- Choose appropriate approximation parameters using helper functions and heuristics\n",
    "- Navigate the trade-offs between approximation fidelity and computational efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous sessions, we explored the foundations of Gaussian processes and built models with various kernels and likelihoods. However, you may have noticed that as datasets grow larger, GP computations become increasingly expensive. The standard GP formulation requires inverting an $n \\times n$ covariance matrix, where $n$ is the number of data points. This operation has $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ computational complexity and $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ memory requirements—quickly becoming prohibitive for datasets with thousands of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we'll explore two powerful approaches to overcome these computational barriers: sparse GP approximations using inducing points, and the Hilbert Space GP (HSGP) method. These techniques allow us to apply GP models to much larger datasets while maintaining the flexibility and uncertainty quantification that make GPs so valuable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of these methods as strategic compromises: we trade away some exactness in our GP representation to gain massive improvements in speed and scalability. The key question we'll answer throughout this session is: *how do we make this trade-off intelligently?*"

    "\n",
    "Before diving into solutions, let's develop intuition for *why* standard GPs become computationally expensive. The bottleneck lies in computing and inverting the covariance matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a GP with $n$ observations, we need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compute** the $n \\times n$ covariance matrix $K$ by evaluating the kernel function at all pairs of data points\n",
    "2. **Invert** this matrix (or equivalently, solve a linear system) to compute the marginal likelihood\n",
    "3. **Repeat** these operations at every step during MCMC sampling as hyperparameters change\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix inversion step dominates the computational cost, scaling as $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$. This cubic scaling means that doubling your dataset size increases computation time by roughly 8×. For a dataset with 10,000 points, a full GP could take hours or days to fit, making interactive model development essentially impossible.\n",

The off-diagonal elements show how points are correlated with each other, with the correlation decaying as points become more distant.\n",

    "## Section 3.2: Sparse GP Approximations with Inducing Points\n",
    "\n",
    "The first approach to scaling GPs is the **sparse** or **inducing point** method. The central idea is elegant: instead of computing correlations between all $n$ data points, we select a smaller set of $m < n$ \"inducing points\" (also called \"pseudo-inputs\") that act as summary locations. These inducing points capture the essential structure of the function, allowing us to approximate the full GP at a fraction of the computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of inducing points like strategic observation posts. If you're trying to understand temperature variations across a city, you don't need thermometers at every house—carefully placed weather stations at key locations can give you an excellent picture of the temperature field everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the approximation reduces complexity from $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(nm^2)$. When $m \\ll n$, this is a massive speedup. The trade-off is that our approximation quality depends on how well the $m$ inducing points can represent the underlying function.\n",

    "This plot reveals several important features of the sparse GP approximation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The posterior mean (red line) closely tracks the true function (blue dashed line)**, demonstrating that just 20 inducing points can effectively represent the smooth underlying pattern in 2000 observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The credible intervals appropriately capture uncertainty**, widening slightly in regions with fewer nearby inducing points and remaining tight where inducing points are dense.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The inducing points (cyan X markers at bottom) are strategically distributed** across the domain, acting as anchor points for the approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key takeaway: we've achieved dramatic computational savings while maintaining excellent approximation quality. For smooth functions and well-placed inducing points, the sparse GP delivers results nearly indistinguishable from the exact GP. The downside of sparse approximations is that they reduce the expressiveness of the GP—reducing the dimension of the covariance matrix effectively reduces the number of eigenvectors that can be used to fit the data."

    "## Section 3.3: Hilbert Space GP (HSGP) Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "While sparse GPs use inducing points to reduce complexity, the Hilbert Space GP (HSGP) takes a completely different approach: it approximates the GP using a **basis function expansion**. This transforms the non-parametric GP into a parametric model with a fixed number of basis functions, making it compatible with standard MCMC samplers and dramatically improving computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical foundation of HSGP comes from spectral analysis of covariance functions. Any stationary covariance kernel can be represented through its **power spectral density**—essentially a Fourier transform that describes the kernel's behavior in frequency space. The HSGP approximation uses a finite set of basis functions (sinusoids) whose coefficients are drawn from a distribution determined by this spectral density.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it this way: instead of defining a function through all pairwise correlations (which requires $n^2$ parameters and $n^3$ operations), HSGP defines it through $m$ basis function coefficients. These basis functions are pre-computed and don't depend on hyperparameters, so we only need to update the coefficients during sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computational complexity drops from $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ for exact GPs to $\\mathcal{O}(nm + m)$ for HSGP, where $m$ is the number of basis functions. Even better, HSGP is fully parametric—we can use `pm.set_data` for predictions without explicitly computing conditional distributions. This makes it much easier to integrate an HSGP into your existing PyMC model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, unlike many other GP approximations, HSGPs can be used anywhere within a model and with any likelihood function. This flexibility is a major advantage over methods like sparse GPs that work best with Gaussian likelihoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HSGP Restrictions\n",
    "\n",
    "The HSGP approximation does carry some restrictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It **can only be used with stationary covariance kernels** such as the Matérn family or ExpQuad. The kernel must implement the `power_spectral_density` method.\n",
    "2. It **does not scale well with input dimension**. HSGP is a good choice for 1D processes (like time series) or 2D spatial processes, but likely not efficient beyond 3 dimensions.\n",
    "3. It **may struggle with very rapidly varying processes**. If the process changes very quickly relative to the domain extent, you may need very large $m$ to accurately represent it.\n",
    "4. **For smaller datasets, the full unapproximated GP may still be more efficient**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Parameters: m and c\n",
    "\n",
    "HSGP approximations are controlled by two parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **m**: The number of basis functions. Larger $m$ gives better approximation quality but increases computational cost. Think of $m$ as the \"resolution\" of your approximation—more basis functions can represent more complex, rapidly-varying patterns. Increasing $m$ helps the HSGP approximate GPs with smaller lengthscales.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **c**: The boundary extension factor. HSGP basis functions are defined on a finite domain $[-L, L]$ where $L = c \\cdot S$ and $S$ is half the range of your centered data. Larger $c$ values help approximate GPs with longer lengthscales and ensure predictions away from data aren't affected by boundary conditions. However, increasing $c$ may require increasing $m$ to compensate for loss of fidelity at smaller lengthscales.\n",
    "\n",
    "The art of using HSGP effectively lies in choosing $m$ and $c$ appropriately for your data and expected lengthscales. Fortunately, PyMC provides a helper function to get you started."

    "\n",
    "**Left panel (L=5, c=1.0)**: When $L$ equals the data range, all basis vectors are forced to pinch to zero at the boundaries (at $x=-5$ and $x=5$). This means the HSGP approximation becomes poor near the edges of your data. This is why we need $c > 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Middle panel (L=6, c=1.2)**: With $c=1.2$, the basis functions extend beyond the data range and are no longer forced to zero at the data boundaries. This helps the approximation remain accurate across the entire domain. Values of $c$ around 1.2 are considered the minimum for reasonable approximations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Right panel (L=20, c=4.0, m=5)**: With larger $L$ or $c$, the basis functions become lower frequency (longer wavelength). Notice how the first basis function (blue) is nearly flat—it's becoming partially unidentifiable with an intercept term. This is why we sometimes need to drop the first basis function, or increase $m$ to compensate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the basis functions are sinusoids with increasing frequency. Lower-order basis functions capture long-range trends, while higher-order functions capture increasingly rapid oscillations. An HSGP approximation works by taking a weighted sum of these basis functions.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we've tackled one of the most practical challenges in GP modeling: scaling to larger datasets. We explored two complementary approaches that dramatically reduce computational complexity while maintaining the core benefits of GP modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sparse GP Approximations\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparse methods reduce complexity from $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(nm^2)$ by representing the GP through $m < n$ strategically placed inducing points. We saw how K-means provides a practical initialization strategy, and how the FITC approximation balances speed with uncertainty quantification. These methods work well for moderately large datasets where inducing points can be placed thoughtfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HSGP Approximations\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hilbert Space GP uses basis function expansions to achieve $\\mathcal{O}(nm + m)$ complexity. By representing the GP as a weighted sum of pre-computed sinusoidal basis functions, HSGP becomes fully parametric and easy to integrate into larger models. The approximation quality is controlled by $m$ (number of basis functions) and $c$ (boundary factor), which can be chosen using PyMC's `approx_hsgp_hyperparams` helper function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "We learned that choosing between these methods requires understanding:\n",
    "- Your dataset size and structure\n",
    "- Whether your kernel is stationary\n",
    "- The dimensionality of your input space\n",
    "- The expected range of lengthscales\n",
    "- Whether you need exact inference or can tolerate approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approximations involve trade-offs—we exchange some exactness for massive computational gains. The art lies in making these trade-offs intelligently based on your specific application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Looking Ahead\n",
    "\n",
    "With these scaling techniques in your toolkit, you can now apply GP models to real-world datasets that would have been computationally prohibitive with exact inference. In the next session, we'll explore multi-output GPs and comprehensive case studies that bring together all the concepts from this workshop, including using HSGP for complex real-world modeling tasks."
