This heavy-tailed behavior allows for surprising local variations while still maintaining some global structure. You'd use this when you expect your data to have unpredictable multi-scale variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**With α = 2.0**: We see moderate smoothness with the ability to capture both rapid local changes and slower global trends. This is often a good middle ground when you're unsure about the scale structure of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**With α = 10.0**: The functions become noticeably smoother and more predictable, approaching the behavior of our Matérn kernels. The multi-scale mixing is still present but less pronounced.\n",
    "\n",
    "**With α = 100.0**: These functions are nearly identical to what we'd get from an ExpQuad kernel—silky smooth and infinitely differentiable. At this point, there's effectively only one dominant lengthscale.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical guidance**: Start with Matérn 5/2 for most problems. If you find yourself torn between multiple lengthscale values (the data seems to have both fine details and broad trends), try RQ with α ~ 2-5. If posterior estimates push α very high (> 50), you might as well use ExpQuad. If α stays very low (< 1), your data truly has multi-scale structure that can't be captured by a single lengthscale.\n",

    "Here's a practical decision framework based on what you know (or suspect) about your data:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Start With These Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Is your function smooth everywhere, or does it have sharp features?**\n",
    "- Smooth everywhere → ExpQuad or Matérn 5/2\n",
    "- Occasional sharp features or kinks → Matérn 3/2\n",
    "- Very rough or irregular → Matérn 1/2 (rarely used)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Does your data have obvious periodic patterns?**\n",
    "- Clear, exact repetition → Periodic kernel (or composed with others)\n",
    "- Periodic but changing over time → Locally Periodic (ExpQuad × Periodic)\n",
    "- No periodicity → Skip Periodic entirely\n",
    "\n",
    "**Are there multiple timescales or characteristic lengths?**\n",
    "- Single dominant scale → Matérn 5/2 or ExpQuad\n",
    "- Multiple scales that can be separated → Additive composition (k₁ + k₂)\n",
    "- Multiple scales that interact → Rational Quadratic or multiplicative composition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Is there a trend component?**\n",
    "- Linear trend → Include Linear kernel (usually composed with others)\n",
    "- Polynomial trend → Linear × Linear for quadratic, etc.\n",
    "- Complex trend → Use smooth kernel with long lengthscale\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Conservative Default\n",
    "\n",
    "**When in doubt, start with Matérn 5/2.** It's smooth enough for most applications without being overly smooth like ExpQuad, and it generalizes well across problem domains. This has become the de facto recommendation in modern GP practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Warning Signs of Poor Kernel Choice\n",
    "\n",
    "Watch for these indicators that your kernel might be misspecified:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shrinking lengthscale with more data**: If your lengthscale posterior keeps getting smaller as you add more observations, your kernel is likely too smooth for the data. The model is trying to capture roughness by shrinking the lengthscale indefinitely. Consider switching to a rougher kernel (e.g., Matérn 5/2 → Matérn 3/2) or adding complexity through composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Very wide posterior distributions**: If hyperparameter posteriors are extremely broad even with substantial data, the kernel might not match the data structure. Try a different kernel family or consider composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Systematic residual patterns**: If your posterior predictive checks reveal clear patterns in the residuals (e.g., unmodeled periodicity, unmodeled trend), your kernel is missing structure. Add appropriate components through composition.\n",

    "Looking at the plot, we see clear temporal patterns in the annual disaster counts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Early period (1851-1890s)**: Disaster rates are notably higher, with several years experiencing 5-6 disasters. This reflects the dangerous conditions of 19th-century mining—inadequate safety regulations, primitive equipment, and poor ventilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Later period (1900s onward)**: The disaster rate appears to decline, with most years having 0-2 disasters. This likely reflects improving safety standards, better mining technology, and stricter regulations following major disasters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key observation**: The rate appears to change smoothly over time rather than in discrete jumps. This makes the coal mining dataset perfect for GP modeling—we want to capture this smooth temporal trend without assuming a specific parametric form (like exponential decay).\n",

    "**Link function**: The Poisson distribution parameterizes the rate $\\lambda > 0$, but our GP can range over all real numbers. We use the **log link**: $\\log(\\lambda) = f(t)$, which means $\\lambda = \\exp(f(t))$. This ensures the rate is always positive regardless of what the GP predicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kernel choice**: We'll use Matérn 5/2, which allows smooth but not infinitely smooth variations—appropriate for a disaster rate that might change gradually as mining practices evolve. A lengthscale prior that's weakly informative over the ~110-year timespan makes sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prior considerations**: We need to be thoughtful about the GP prior on the log-scale. Since disasters are relatively rare events (at most 6 per year), $\\log(\\lambda)$ should be modest—probably between -2 (≈0.14 disasters/year) and 2 (≈7.4 disasters/year)."

    "**`pm.Deterministic('lambda', pm.math.exp(f))`**: This is the **inverse link function**, transforming from log-rate to actual rate. By tracking it as a Deterministic variable, we can examine the disaster rate $\\lambda$ directly in our posterior, not just the log-rate. This makes interpretation much easier.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Early period (1851-1890s)**: The estimated disaster rate is high, around 3-4 disasters per year. The model has learned that Victorian-era mining was substantially more dangerous, reflected in the elevated rate during this period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transition period (~1890-1900)**: The rate begins to decline as safety practices gradually improved. The GP smoothly captures this transition without us imposing any particular functional form—no exponential decay, no linear trend, just letting the data speak.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Later period (1900-1962)**: The disaster rate settles to a lower level, around 1-2 disasters per year. While still tragic, this represents a substantial improvement from the earlier period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Uncertainty quantification**: The credible interval (shaded region) reflects our uncertainty about the true underlying rate. Notice it's wider in periods with high variability in the observed counts—the Poisson variance equals its mean, so high-rate periods naturally have more scatter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The power of the log link**: By modeling $\\log(\\lambda)$ with a GP and exponentiating, we guaranteed $\\lambda > 0$ throughout. This is essential for count data—we never predict negative disaster rates, even though our GP can range over all real numbers.\n",

    "Beautiful! The additive GP has successfully decomposed the Mauna Loa CO₂ data into its constituent patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The trend component** captures the steady decade-long increase from fossil fuel emissions. The model learned that this variation happens on a time scale of years, with a large lengthscale parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The seasonal component** captures the annual oscillations from vegetation dynamics. The model learned that this pattern repeats exactly every year (period=1.0) with an amplitude of several ppm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The combined fit** (dark red line) shows how these independent patterns add together to explain the observations. The credible intervals (shown as progressively lighter shades of red for 68%, 95%, and wider intervals) reflect our uncertainty—notice how the uncertainty bands grow slightly when extrapolating beyond year 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the power of additive models: when your data contains multiple **independent** sources of variation, each kernel explains a different aspect. The GP automatically learns how to decompose the signal based on the different correlation structures (long-term smooth trend vs. yearly periodic cycle).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key intuition**: Addition works when patterns don't interact—when one doesn't modulate the other. The CO₂ trend doesn't change the seasonal amplitude, and the seasonal cycle doesn't affect the long-term trend. They're independent physical processes that simply superimpose.\n",

    "### Why Multiplication Worked Where Addition Failed\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the three models side by side reveals the critical difference:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model 1: Pure Periodic (Left Panel)**\n",
    "This model assumes the periodic pattern exists everywhere with constant amplitude. Outside the central region where the true periodicity exists, the model confidently predicts oscillations that aren't there. This is exactly wrong—it extrapolates periodic behavior globally when the data only shows it locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model 2: Additive (Center Panel)**\n",
    "The additive model tried to explain the data with two independent components: a smooth function plus a global periodic function. While it might capture some structure, it fundamentally misunderstands the data generation process. The smooth component can't \"turn off\" the periodic component in regions where it shouldn't exist. This model will likely predict some oscillations outside the central region (though less extreme than Model 1) and may underestimate the periodic amplitude in the central region where it's strong.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model 3: Locally Periodic (Right Panel)**\n",
    "The multiplicative model correctly captures the localized periodicity. The posterior mean (red line) closely follows the true function (blue dashed line), showing strong oscillations in the central region and smooth, non-oscillatory behavior outside. The credible interval grows appropriately in regions far from the data, but it doesn't confidently predict spurious oscillations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The mathematical insight**: When you multiply kernels, the covariance $k_1(x, x') \\times k_2(x, x')$ is high only when **both** kernels have high covariance. The ExpQuad kernel creates an envelope of high covariance around the central region. The Periodic kernel creates high covariance at regular intervals. Their product creates periodic covariance **only within the envelope**—exactly what we wanted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use locally periodic kernels**:\n",
    "- Seasonal patterns that emerge or fade over time\n",
    "- Periodic phenomena that only occur in specific regions of input space\n",
    "- Oscillatory behavior that's modulated by another process\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key takeaway**: Multiplication is not just for \"growing amplitude\"—it's the right tool whenever one pattern should **gate** or **localize** another. The order doesn't matter in multiplication (k₁ × k₂ = k₂ × k₁), but the interpretation does: think of one kernel as the \"envelope\" and the other as the \"carrier signal.\"\n",

    "### Encoding Domain Knowledge Through Kernel Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond choosing from standard kernels, you can encode specific domain knowledge directly into kernel structure. Here are a few advanced patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Symmetry**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you know your function has reflective symmetry around the origin ($f(x) = f(-x)$), you can enforce this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "k_{\\text{symmetric}}(x, x') = k(x, x') + k(-x, x')\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This doubles the effective data by using the symmetry constraint. For example, if you're modeling physical phenomena that must be symmetric (like the electric field around a charged sphere), enforcing this constraint improves efficiency and prevents the model from learning spurious asymmetries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Low-Dimensional Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you suspect your high-dimensional input actually varies along a low-dimensional manifold, project before applying the kernel:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "k_{\\text{low-dim}}(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{x}') = k(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}')\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{A}$ is a low-rank matrix (e.g., $m \\times d$ where $m \\ll d$). This is like doing dimensionality reduction before GP regression. You can learn $\\mathbf{A}$ jointly with the GP, creating a model that discovers the relevant low-dimensional structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Categorical Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "For categorical inputs (e.g., \"red\", \"blue\", \"green\"), use one-hot encoding with product kernels:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# For 2D input: continuous variable and 3-level categorical\n",
    "# Encode categorical as [1,0,0], [0,1,0], [0,0,1]\n",
    "with pm.Model() as model:\n",
    "    # Continuous dimension\n",
    "    ell_cont = pm.Gamma('ell_cont', alpha=2, beta=1)\n",
    "    cov_continuous = pm.gp.cov.Matern52(1, ls=ell_cont)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Categorical dimension (3 levels encoded as 3D one-hot)\n",
    "    ell_cat = pm.Gamma('ell_cat', alpha=2, beta=1, shape=3)\n",
    "    cov_categorical = pm.gp.cov.ExpQuad(3, ls=ell_cat)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Combine multiplicatively\n",
    "    cov_total = cov_continuous * cov_categorical\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The model learns lengthscales for the categorical encoding, effectively learning whether categories should share information. Small lengthscales mean the categories are very different; large lengthscales mean they're similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Periodic Boundary Conditions**\n",
    "\n",
    "For phenomena defined on a circle (e.g., compass directions, time of day), the input space wraps around. Instead of treating 359° and 1° as distant, encode the input as $(\\cos(\\theta), \\sin(\\theta))$ and use a standard kernel on this 2D representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use these patterns**: Only when you have strong domain knowledge that justifies the constraint. Imposing wrong symmetry or structure will harm performance. When in doubt, stick with simpler kernels and let the data speak.\n",
    "\n",
    "These advanced patterns are mostly relevant for specialized applications. For most practical GP modeling, you'll succeed with the standard kernels and composition rules we've explored. The key is to start simple and add complexity only when data or domain knowledge clearly indicates it's needed.\n",
    "\n",

Gaussian distributions are not robust to outliers: a single extreme value can dramatically affect inference.\n",

    "Excellent! The posterior mean (red line) closely follows the true function (blue dashed line), essentially ignoring the outliers (red X markers). The Student-T likelihood has successfully downweighted the extreme observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare this to what would happen with a Gaussian likelihood—the outliers would pull the predicted function toward them, creating bulges in the estimate. The Student-T likelihood's heavy tails allow the model to say \"these observations are just noise from the tail of the distribution,\" rather than trying to fit them.\n",

    "**When to use robust likelihoods**:\n",
    "- When you suspect your data contains outliers\n",
    "- When measurement errors might occasionally be much larger than usual\n",
    "- When you want your model to be less sensitive to a few extreme values\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost is slower sampling (since we use `pm.gp.Latent`), but the benefit is much more reliable inference in the presence of outliers."
