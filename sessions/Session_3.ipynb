    "# Session 3: Scaling with HSGP and Sparse Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this session, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the computational bottlenecks of standard Gaussian processes\n",
    "- Apply inducing point methods and sparse approximations to scale GPs to larger datasets\n",
    "- Implement Hilbert Space GP (HSGP) approximations in PyMC\n",
    "- Choose appropriate approximation parameters using helper functions and heuristics\n",
    "- Navigate the trade-offs between approximation fidelity and computational efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous sessions, we explored the foundations of Gaussian processes and built models with various kernels and likelihoods. However, you may have noticed that as datasets grow larger, GP computations become increasingly expensive. The standard GP formulation requires inverting an $n \\times n$ covariance matrix, where $n$ is the number of data points. This operation has $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ computational complexity and $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ memory requirements—quickly becoming prohibitive for datasets with thousands of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we'll explore two powerful approaches to overcome these computational barriers: sparse GP approximations using inducing points, and the Hilbert Space GP (HSGP) method. These techniques allow us to apply GP models to much larger datasets while maintaining the flexibility and uncertainty quantification that make GPs so valuable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of these methods as strategic compromises: we trade away some exactness in our GP representation to gain massive improvements in speed and scalability. The key question we'll answer throughout this session is: *how do we make this trade-off intelligently?*"

    "## Section 3.1: Understanding the Computational Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into solutions, let's develop intuition for *why* standard GPs become computationally expensive. The bottleneck lies in computing and inverting the covariance matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a GP with $n$ observations, we need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compute** the $n \\times n$ covariance matrix $K$ by evaluating the kernel function at all pairs of data points\n",
    "2. **Invert** this matrix (or equivalently, solve a linear system) to compute the marginal likelihood\n",
    "3. **Repeat** these operations at every step during MCMC sampling as hyperparameters change\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix inversion step dominates the computational cost, scaling as $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$. This cubic scaling means that doubling your dataset size increases computation time by roughly 8×. For a dataset with 10,000 points, a full GP could take hours or days to fit, making interactive model development essentially impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Cost of Cubic Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this concrete, consider what happens as we increase dataset size:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **n=50**: Covariance matrix has 2,500 elements, ~125,000 operations to invert\n",
    "- **n=200**: Covariance matrix has 40,000 elements, ~8 million operations to invert (64× more than n=50)\n",
    "- **n=1,000**: Covariance matrix has 1,000,000 elements, ~1 billion operations to invert (8,000× more than n=50)\n",
    "- **n=10,000**: Covariance matrix has 100,000,000 elements, ~1 trillion operations to invert (8,000,000× more than n=50)\n",
    "\n",
    "And remember: these matrix inversions happen at **every MCMC iteration**. For 4,000 samples across 4 chains, that's 16,000 inversions!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where approximation methods become essential. Rather than abandoning GPs for large datasets, we can use clever mathematical tricks to reduce computational complexity while retaining most of the modeling flexibility."

    "1. **The posterior mean (red line) closely tracks the true function (blue dashed line)**, demonstrating that just 20 inducing points can effectively represent the smooth underlying pattern in 2000 observations.\n",

For smooth functions and well-placed inducing points, the sparse GP delivers results nearly indistinguishable from the exact GP. The downside of sparse approximations is that they reduce the expressiveness of the GP—reducing the dimension of the covariance matrix effectively reduces the number of eigenvectors that can be used to fit the data."

    "## Section 3.3: Hilbert Space GP (HSGP) Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "While sparse GPs use inducing points to reduce complexity, the Hilbert Space GP (HSGP) takes a completely different approach: it approximates the GP using a **basis function expansion**. This transforms the non-parametric GP into a parametric model with a fixed number of basis functions, making it compatible with standard MCMC samplers and dramatically improving computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical foundation of HSGP comes from spectral analysis of covariance functions. Any stationary covariance kernel can be represented through its **power spectral density**—essentially a Fourier transform that describes the kernel's behavior in frequency space. The HSGP approximation uses a finite set of basis functions (sinusoids) whose coefficients are drawn from a distribution determined by this spectral density.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it this way: instead of defining a function through all pairwise correlations (which requires $n^2$ parameters and $n^3$ operations), HSGP defines it through $m$ basis function coefficients. These basis functions are pre-computed and don't depend on hyperparameters, so we only need to update the coefficients during sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computational complexity drops from $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ for exact GPs to $\\mathcal{O}(nm + m)$ for HSGP, where $m$ is the number of basis functions. Even better, HSGP is fully parametric—we can use `pm.set_data` for predictions without explicitly computing conditional distributions. This makes it much easier to integrate an HSGP into your existing PyMC model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, unlike many other GP approximations, HSGPs can be used anywhere within a model and with any likelihood function. This flexibility is a major advantage over methods like sparse GPs that work best with Gaussian likelihoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HSGP Restrictions\n",
    "\n",
    "The HSGP approximation does carry some restrictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It **can only be used with stationary covariance kernels** such as the Matérn family or ExpQuad. The kernel must implement the `power_spectral_density` method.\n",
    "2. It **does not scale well with input dimension**. HSGP is a good choice for 1D processes (like time series) or 2D spatial processes, but likely not efficient beyond 3 dimensions.\n",
    "3. It **may struggle with very rapidly varying processes**. If the process changes very quickly relative to the domain extent, you may need very large $m$ to accurately represent it.\n",
    "4. **For smaller datasets, the full unapproximated GP may still be more efficient**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Parameters: m and c\n",
    "\n",
    "HSGP approximations are controlled by two parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **m**: The number of basis functions. Larger $m$ gives better approximation quality but increases computational cost. Think of $m$ as the \"resolution\" of your approximation—more basis functions can represent more complex, rapidly-varying patterns. Increasing $m$ helps the HSGP approximate GPs with smaller lengthscales.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **c**: The boundary extension factor. HSGP basis functions are defined on a finite domain $[-L, L]$ where $L = c \\cdot S$ and $S$ is half the range of your centered data. Larger $c$ values help approximate GPs with longer lengthscales and ensure predictions away from data aren't affected by boundary conditions. However, increasing $c$ may require increasing $m$ to compensate for loss of fidelity at smaller lengthscales.\n",
    "\n",
    "The art of using HSGP effectively lies in choosing $m$ and $c$ appropriately for your data and expected lengthscales. Fortunately, PyMC provides a helper function to get you started."

    "**Left panel (L=5, c=1.0)**: When $L$ equals the data range, all basis vectors are forced to pinch to zero at the boundaries (at $x=-5$ and $x=5$). This means the HSGP approximation becomes poor near the edges of your data. This is why we need $c > 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Middle panel (L=6, c=1.2)**: With $c=1.2$, the basis functions extend beyond the data range and are no longer forced to zero at the data boundaries. This helps the approximation remain accurate across the entire domain. Values of $c$ around 1.2 are considered the minimum for reasonable approximations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Right panel (L=20, c=4.0, m=5)**: With larger $L$ or $c$, the basis functions become lower frequency (longer wavelength). Notice how the first basis function (blue) is nearly flat—it's becoming partially unidentifiable with an intercept term. This is why we sometimes need to drop the first basis function, or increase $m$ to compensate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the basis functions are sinusoids with increasing frequency. Lower-order basis functions capture long-range trends, while higher-order functions capture increasingly rapid oscillations. An HSGP approximation works by taking a weighted sum of these basis functions.\n",

    "- The approximation looks good for $m = 30$ or $m = 15$ with $c=2.5$. The rest show clear differences.\n",

    "\n",

    "The HSGP successfully learned the spatial structure of mineral concentrations across Walker Lake. Notice several important features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Smooth spatial interpolation**: The predicted surface (left panel) provides smooth estimates even in areas between observations, capturing the underlying spatial pattern while avoiding overfitting to individual noisy measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Irregular sampling handled naturally**: Unlike grid-based methods, the HSGP works seamlessly with the irregular sampling pattern (right panel), where some areas have dense measurements and others are sparse.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Computational efficiency**: Despite having several hundred observations and predicting on a fine grid (1,600 locations), the HSGP completed fitting and prediction efficiently using basis function expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For 2D problems like this spatial dataset, remember that the total number of basis functions is $m_1 \\times m_2$. This is still far more efficient than exact inference, but it shows why HSGP doesn't scale well beyond 3 dimensions—the basis functions multiply quickly! For higher-dimensional problems, sparse GP methods or other approximations may be more suitable."

    "- **Highly relevant (< 1)**: Moving just one standard deviation causes substantial decorrelation. The model sees the function changing rapidly with this feature.\n",

    "3. **Right side of the plot (large lengthscales > 10)**: Features the model has learned to downweight or ignore.
