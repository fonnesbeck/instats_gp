    "# Session 3: Scaling with HSGP and Sparse Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this session, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the computational bottlenecks of standard Gaussian processes\n",
    "- Apply inducing point methods and sparse approximations to scale GPs to larger datasets\n",
    "- Implement Hilbert Space GP (HSGP) approximations in PyMC\n",
    "- Choose appropriate approximation parameters using helper functions and heuristics\n",
    "- Navigate the trade-offs between approximation fidelity and computational efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous sessions, we explored the foundations of Gaussian processes and built models with various kernels and likelihoods. However, you may have noticed that as datasets grow larger, GP computations become increasingly expensive. The standard GP formulation requires inverting an $n \\times n$ covariance matrix, where $n$ is the number of data points. This operation has $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ computational complexity and $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ memory requirements—quickly becoming prohibitive for datasets with thousands of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we'll explore two powerful approaches to overcome these computational barriers: sparse GP approximations using inducing points, and the Hilbert Space GP (HSGP) method. These techniques allow us to apply GP models to much larger datasets while maintaining the flexibility and uncertainty quantification that make GPs so valuable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of these methods as strategic compromises: we trade away some exactness in our GP representation to gain massive improvements in speed and scalability. The key question we'll answer throughout this session is: *how do we make this trade-off intelligently?*"

    "\n",
    "Before diving into solutions, let's develop intuition for *why* standard GPs become computationally expensive. The bottleneck lies in computing and inverting the covariance matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a GP with $n$ observations, we need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compute** the $n \\times n$ covariance matrix $K$ by evaluating the kernel function at all pairs of data points\n",
    "2. **Invert** this matrix (or equivalently, solve a linear system) to compute the marginal likelihood\n",
    "3. **Repeat** these operations at every step during MCMC sampling as hyperparameters change\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix inversion step dominates the computational cost, scaling as $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$. This cubic scaling means that doubling your dataset size increases computation time by roughly 8×. For a dataset with 10,000 points, a full GP could take hours or days to fit, making interactive model development essentially impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Cost of Cubic Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this concrete, consider what happens as we increase dataset size:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **n=50**: Covariance matrix has 2,500 elements, ~125,000 operations to invert\n",
    "- **n=200**: Covariance matrix has 40,000 elements, ~8 million operations to invert (64× more than n=50)\n",

    "- **n=10,000**: Covariance matrix has 100,000,000 elements, ~1 trillion operations to invert (8,000,000× more than n=50)\n",
    "\n",
    "And remember: these matrix inversions happen at **every MCMC iteration**. For 4,000 samples across 4 chains, that's 16,000 inversions!\n",

    "### Understanding Sparse GPs: The Inducing Point Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard GPs require computing and inverting an $n \\times n$ covariance matrix $K_{nn}$, where $n$ is the number of observations. As we saw earlier, this $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ operation becomes prohibitively expensive for large datasets. Sparse GPs solve this by introducing a clever approximation based on **inducing points**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Core Approximation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of modeling correlations between all $n$ observations directly, sparse GPs introduce a smaller set of $m$ **inducing points** (also called pseudo-inputs) at strategic locations $\\mathbf{X}_u$. These inducing points act as an **information bottleneck**: all correlations between observations flow through this compressed representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like this**: Imagine understanding temperature patterns across a country. Rather than measuring correlations between all pairs of cities (expensive), you could:\n",
    "1. Select $m$ strategically-placed weather stations (inducing points)\n",
    "2. Model how each city correlates with these stations\n",
    "3. Infer city-to-city relationships indirectly through the stations\n",
    "\n",
    "This changes the problem from requiring $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ operations to just $\\mathcal{O}(nm^2)$ operations, where $m \\ll n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Mathematical Details\n",
    "\n",
    "For a standard GP, the posterior mean and covariance at test locations $\\mathbf{x}_*$ are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_* &= K_{*n} \\underbrace{K_{nn}^{-1}}_{\\mathcal{O}(n^3)} \\mathbf{y} \\\\\n",
    "\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_* &= K_{**} - K_{*n} \\underbrace{K_{nn}^{-1}}_{\\mathcal{O}(n^3)} K_{n*}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The bottleneck is inverting the large $n \\times n$ matrix $K_{nn}$. This happens at every MCMC iteration as hyperparameters change.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sparse GPs avoid this** by factorizing the covariance structure through inducing points. The FITC (Fully Independent Training Conditional) approximation assumes observations are conditionally independent given the inducing point values $\\mathbf{u}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(\\mathbf{f} \\mid \\mathbf{u}) \\approx \\prod_{i=1}^n p(f_i \\mid \\mathbf{u})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to the approximate posterior:\n",
    "\n",

    "\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_* &= K_{*m} \\underbrace{K_{mm}^{-1}}_{\\mathcal{O}(m^3)} K_{mn} \\Lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{y} \\\\\n",
    "\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_* &= K_{**} - K_{*m} \\left(K_{mm}^{-1} - K_{mm}^{-1} \\Sigma_m K_{mm}^{-1}\\right) K_{m*}\n",

    "\n",
    "**The key insight**: We only invert the small $m \\times m$ matrix $K_{mm}$, not the huge $n \\times n$ matrix. We compute:\n",
    "- $K_{mm}$: $m \\times m$ covariance between inducing points (invert this: $\\mathcal{O}(m^3)$)\n",
    "- $K_{nm}$: $n \\times m$ covariance between observations and inducing points (no inversion needed)\n",
    "- $\\Lambda$: diagonal, so trivial to invert\n",

    "#### What Inducing Points Actually Do\n",
    "\n",
    "Inducing points don't replace your data—they **summarize** it by playing two complementary roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **As anchor points**: They define strategic locations where the GP explicitly represents function values. The function everywhere else is determined by kernel-based interpolation from these anchors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **As a compression mechanism**: Instead of tracking $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ pairwise correlations between observations, the GP only needs:\n",
    "   - $\\frac{m(m-1)}{2}$ correlations between inducing points ($m \\times m$ relationships)\n",
    "   - $n \\times m$ correlations from each observation to inducing points\n",
    "\n",
    "The FITC approximation assumes that once we know the function values at the inducing points, observations become conditionally independent. This is a strong assumption but works well in practice when:\n",
    "- The function is smooth (appropriate kernel)\n",
    "- Inducing points are well-distributed\n",
    "- $m$ is large enough to capture the function's complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Choosing Inducing Point Locations\n",
    "\n",
    "The approximation quality depends critically on where we place the inducing points. A practical strategy is **K-means clustering**:\n",
    "- Places inducing points at cluster centers in the input space\n",
    "- Naturally concentrates them where data is dense (important regions)\n",
    "- Still ensures coverage across the entire domain\n",
    "- Fast and deterministic (given a random seed)\n",
    "\n",
    "For our 2000-observation dataset, we'll use $m=20$ inducing points—a 100× compression that still captures the essential structure."

    "## Section 3.3: Hilbert Space GP (HSGP) Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "While sparse GPs use inducing points to reduce complexity, the Hilbert Space GP (HSGP) takes a completely different approach: it approximates the GP using a **basis function expansion**. This transforms the non-parametric GP into a parametric model with a fixed number of basis functions, making it compatible with standard MCMC samplers and dramatically improving computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical foundation of HSGP comes from spectral analysis of covariance functions. Any stationary covariance kernel can be represented through its **power spectral density**—essentially a Fourier transform that describes the kernel's behavior in frequency space. The HSGP approximation uses a finite set of basis functions (sinusoids) whose coefficients are drawn from a distribution determined by this spectral density.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it this way: instead of defining a function through all pairwise correlations (which requires $n^2$ parameters and $n^3$ operations), HSGP defines it through $m$ basis function coefficients. These basis functions are pre-computed and don't depend on hyperparameters, so we only need to update the coefficients during sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computational complexity drops from $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ for exact GPs to $\\mathcal{O}(nm + m)$ for HSGP, where $m$ is the number of basis functions. Even better, HSGP is fully parametric—we can use `pm.set_data` for predictions without explicitly computing conditional distributions. This makes it much easier to integrate an HSGP into your existing PyMC model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, unlike many other GP approximations, HSGPs can be used anywhere within a model and with any likelihood function. This flexibility is a major advantage over methods like sparse GPs that work best with Gaussian likelihoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HSGP Restrictions\n",
    "\n",
    "The HSGP approximation does carry some restrictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It **can only be used with stationary covariance kernels** such as the Matérn family or ExpQuad. The kernel must implement the `power_spectral_density` method.\n",
    "2. It **does not scale well with input dimension**. HSGP is a good choice for 1D processes (like time series) or 2D spatial processes, but likely not efficient beyond 3 dimensions.\n",
    "3. It **may struggle with very rapidly varying processes**. If the process changes very quickly relative to the domain extent, you may need very large $m$ to accurately represent it.\n",
    "4. **For smaller datasets, the full unapproximated GP may still be more efficient**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Parameters: m and c\n",
    "\n",
    "HSGP approximations are controlled by two parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **m**: The number of basis functions. Larger $m$ gives better approximation quality but increases computational cost. Think of $m$ as the \"resolution\" of your approximation—more basis functions can represent more complex, rapidly-varying patterns. Increasing $m$ helps the HSGP approximate GPs with smaller lengthscales.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **c**: The boundary extension factor. HSGP basis functions are defined on a finite domain $[-L, L]$ where $L = c \\cdot S$ and $S$ is half the range of your centered data. Larger $c$ values help approximate GPs with longer lengthscales and ensure predictions away from data aren't affected by boundary conditions. However, increasing $c$ may require increasing $m$ to compensate for loss of fidelity at smaller lengthscales.\n",
    "\n",
    "The art of using HSGP effectively lies in choosing $m$ and $c$ appropriately for your data and expected lengthscales. Fortunately, PyMC provides a helper function to get you started."

    "\n",
    "**Left panel (L=5, c=1.0)**: When $L$ equals the data range, all basis vectors are forced to pinch to zero at the boundaries (at $x=-5$ and $x=5$). This means the HSGP approximation becomes poor near the edges of your data. This is why we need $c > 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Middle panel (L=6, c=1.2)**: With $c=1.2$, the basis functions extend beyond the data range and are no longer forced to zero at the data boundaries. This helps the approximation remain accurate across the entire domain. Values of $c$ around 1.2 are considered the minimum for reasonable approximations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Right panel (L=20, c=4.0, m=5)**: With larger $L$ or $c$, the basis functions become lower frequency (longer wavelength). Notice how the first basis function (blue) is nearly flat—it's becoming partially unidentifiable with an intercept term. This is why we sometimes need to drop the first basis function, or increase $m$ to compensate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the basis functions are sinusoids with increasing frequency. Lower-order basis functions capture long-range trends, while higher-order functions capture increasingly rapid oscillations. An HSGP approximation works by taking a weighted sum of these basis functions.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Start with `approx_hsgp_hyperparams`**: This function provides data-driven recommendations based on your input range and expected lengthscales. It uses approximation error bounds from the HSGP literature to choose $c$ large enough to handle your largest expected lengthscales and $m$ large enough for your smallest lengthscales.\n",

    "2. **Understand the trade-offs**:\n",
    "   - **Increasing $m$ helps approximate GPs with smaller lengthscales** at the cost of increased computation\n",
    "   - **Increasing $c$ helps approximate GPs with larger lengthscales** but may require increasing $m$ to compensate for loss of fidelity at smaller scales\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Experiment with your specific problem**: You will need to verify approximation quality across your range of lengthscales. The recommendations from `approx_hsgp_hyperparams` provide a starting point, but you may be able to reduce $m$ for computational savings if your function is smooth, or need to increase it if the process varies rapidly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Check the basis vectors if sampling struggles**: The first eigenvector can become unidentifiable with an intercept when $c$ is large. Consider using the `drop_first` option.\n",

    "\n",
    "The HSGP successfully learned the spatial structure of mineral concentrations across Walker Lake. Notice several important features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Smooth spatial interpolation**: The predicted surface (left panel) provides smooth estimates even in areas between observations, capturing the underlying spatial pattern while avoiding overfitting to individual noisy measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Irregular sampling handled naturally**: Unlike grid-based methods, the HSGP works seamlessly with the irregular sampling pattern (right panel), where some areas have dense measurements and others are sparse.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Computational efficiency**: Despite having several hundred observations and predicting on a fine grid (1,600 locations), the HSGP completed fitting and prediction efficiently using basis function expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For 2D problems like this spatial dataset, remember that the total number of basis functions is $m_1 \\times m_2$. This is still far more efficient than exact inference, but it shows why HSGP doesn't scale well beyond 3 dimensions—the basis functions multiply quickly! For higher-dimensional problems, sparse GP methods or other approximations may be more suitable."

    "- You need exact inference without approximation error\n",
    "- You're using **non-stationary kernels** (e.g., `Linear`, `Polynomial`)\n",
    "- Computation time isn't critical\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Sparse GP (Inducing Points) when:**\n",
    "- Moderate-to-large datasets where exact GP is too slow\n",
    "- Data has **uneven sampling density** (inducing points can be placed strategically)\n",
    "- **Lengthscale is larger than separation between inducing points** (critical condition for good approximation)\n",
    "- You can use domain knowledge or K-means to select good inducing point locations\n",
    "- You're willing to tune the number and placement of inducing points ($m$)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use HSGP when:**\n",
    "- Large datasets (computational advantage grows with $n$)\n",
    "- Using **stationary kernels only** (Matérn, ExpQuad—kernel must implement `power_spectral_density` method)\n",
    "- **Input dimension is low** (1-3 dimensions; doesn't scale well beyond 3D)\n",
    "- Process doesn't vary **extremely rapidly** relative to domain extent\n",
    "- You need to integrate the GP into a larger hierarchical model\n",
    "- You need predictions at many new locations (linear scaling advantage)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical tips:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prototyping**: Start with a low-fidelity HSGP (small $m$) for fast iteration. Once you understand the relevant lengthscales, use `pm.gp.hsgp_approx_hsgp_hyperparams()` or manually dial in appropriate $m$ and $c$ values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Approximation quality**: Be aware that low-fidelity approximations may sometimes give more parsimonious fits than high-fidelity versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inducing points**: Can be selected via K-means (`pm.gp.util.kmeans_inducing_points()`), as a subset of data, or optimized as model parameters."

    "### Interpreting the ARD Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The forest plot above shows the posterior distributions of lengthscales for each feature. Because we **standardized all input features** to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1, these lengthscales are directly comparable across features - this is crucial for ARD interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding Lengthscales with Standardized Features\n",
    "\n",
    "A lengthscale represents **the distance you need to move along a feature's axis for function values to become uncorrelated**. With standardized features (mean=0, std=1):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Highly relevant (< 1)**: Moving just one standard deviation causes substantial decorrelation. The model sees the function changing rapidly with this feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Moderately relevant (1-3)**: The function changes moderately. These features contribute to predictions but with less sensitivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weakly relevant (> 10)**: The covariance becomes nearly constant across this feature's range. Moving even 10 standard deviations barely affects predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Effectively irrelevant (> 100)**: The model has learned to ignore this feature entirely. The covariance is nearly independent of this input.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What to Look for in the Forest Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "Examine the lengthscale distributions shown above:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Left side of the plot (small lengthscales)**: Features with tight distributions clustered near 0-2 are the most important predictors. These typically include features like **LSTAT** (% lower status population), **RM** (avg rooms), and **PTRATIO** (pupil-teacher ratio) - all well-known drivers of housing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Middle range (lengthscales 3-10)**: Features that contribute moderately to predictions. They matter, but changes in these features have less dramatic effects on house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Right side of the plot (large lengthscales > 10)**: Features the model has learned to downweight or ignore. This could indicate true irrelevance or that their information is captured by other correlated features. For example, **CHAS** (Charles River proximity) affects relatively few houses in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Power of ARD\n",
    "\n",
    "This automatic feature discovery happens **during model fitting** without any manual intervention. We didn't need to:\n",
    "- Manually select features beforehand\n",
    "- Run separate feature importance analyses  \n",
    "- Fit multiple models and compare\n",
    "\n",
    "The learned lengthscales serve a dual purpose: they're both **correlation parameters** (controlling how smooth the GP is along each dimension) and **importance weights** (telling us which features actually matter for predictions). This makes ARD an elegant solution to the feature selection problem in high-dimensional GP regression."

    "\n",
    "- **ARD identifies which features matter**, potentially reducing the effective dimensionality\n",
    "- **HSGP** can then efficiently handle the relevant dimensions (though remember HSGP works best for 1-3 dimensions)\n",
    "- **Sparse GPs** can scale to larger datasets while still using ARD kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of ARD for feature selection and approximation methods for computational scaling allows you to tackle real-world problems with both many observations and many features.\n",
    "\n",
    "This completes our tour of GP scaling methods. You now have the tools to apply GPs to datasets that would be intractable with exact inference, while automatically discovering which features drive your predictions."
