    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this session, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand what Bayesian non-parametric models are and how Gaussian processes fit into this framework\n",
    "- Connect the familiar concept of multivariate normal distributions to the more general idea of Gaussian processes\n",
    "- Learn the basics of PyMC and how to implement simple models\n",
    "- Understand the roles of mean and covariance functions in defining a GP's behavior\n",
    "- Build and fit your first GP model using real data\n",
    "\n",
    "## LLM-Assisted Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout these notebooks, you'll notice sections marked with 🤖. These are **LLM-assisted exercises** where you'll practice using large language models (like ChatGPT, Claude, or your favorite coding assistant) to help you implement GP concepts. This approach reflects modern data science practice: knowing *what* you want to accomplish and *how* to verify it is often more important than memorizing every implementation detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercises are designed to help you develop the skill of effectively communicating with AI assistants—a critical ability in today's data science workflow. You'll learn to write clear prompts, test implementations, and validate results, building both your GP expertise and your collaborative coding skills."

    "### What Does \"Non-Parametric\" Mean in a GP Context?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we talk about Gaussian processes being \"non-parametric,\" we're not saying they have no parameters—that would be confusing! Instead, we mean that GPs don't assume a fixed functional form with a finite number of parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think about it this way: in linear regression, you commit to a straight line (or hyperplane) defined by a slope and intercept. You're making a strong assumption about the shape of your function before seeing the data. With a GP, you're defining a *distribution over functions*. The data then tells you which functions from this distribution are most plausible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This flexibility makes GPs incredibly powerful for modeling complex, unknown relationships. The \"parameters\" in a GP are actually hyperparameters that control properties like smoothness and lengthscale—they shape the space of possible functions rather than defining a single function."

    "## Section 1.2: Bayesian Inference Primer\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we learn the PyMC API or dive into Gaussian processes, let's build intuition for the Bayesian framework itself. Understanding how we update beliefs with data is fundamental to everything that follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Three-Step Bayesian Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Every Bayesian analysis follows the same three-step pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Specify a probability model**: Assign probability distributions to all unknowns—parameters, predictions, even missing data\n",
    "2. **Calculate the posterior distribution**: Update our beliefs by combining prior knowledge with observed data  \n",
    "3. **Check and interpret**: Validate the model and draw conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow applies whether we're estimating a simple proportion or building complex Gaussian process models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bayes' Theorem: The Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "At its heart, Bayesian inference is about updating beliefs with data. We start with prior knowledge (the prior), observe data (the likelihood), and combine them through multiplication to get updated knowledge (the posterior):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\theta | y) \\propto P(y | \\theta) P(\\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reading this equation aloud:**\n",
    "- **Posterior** ∝ **Likelihood** × **Prior**\n",
    "- What we believe about $\\theta$ after seeing data is proportional to how likely the data would be under different $\\theta$ values, weighted by what we believed before\n",
    "\n",
    "This seemingly simple equation is incredibly powerful. Think of it visually: if your prior was a curve and the likelihood was another curve, the posterior is their product—peaks where both agree, valleys where they disagree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proportionality constant is just a normalization factor ensuring probabilities sum to one—important mathematically, but not essential for building intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Concrete Example: Estimating a Proportion\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's work through a simple analytical example to see Bayesian updating in action. Imagine we want to estimate the probability $\\theta$ that a coin lands heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup**: We flip a coin 5 times and observe 3 heads. What can we infer about $\\theta$?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Specify the model**\n",
    "- **Likelihood** (Binomial): Number of heads follows $\\text{Binomial}(n=5, p=\\theta)$\n",
    "- **Prior** (Beta): We start with a uniform prior, $\\text{Beta}(1, 1)$—maximum uncertainty about $\\theta$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Compute the posterior**\n",
    "\n",
    "The beautiful thing about the Beta-Binomial combination is that we can calculate the posterior analytically—no fancy algorithms needed! This is called *conjugacy*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The posterior is $\\text{Beta}(1+3, 1+2) = \\text{Beta}(4, 3)$. Notice how the parameters simply add:\n",
    "- Prior \"successes\": 1 -> Posterior: 1 + 3 = 4  \n",
