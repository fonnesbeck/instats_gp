        "- Understand what Bayesian non-parametric models are and how Gaussian processes fit into this framework\n",
        "- Connect the familiar concept of multivariate normal distributions to the more general idea of Gaussian processes\n",
        "- Learn the basics of PyMC and how to implement simple models\n",
        "- Understand the roles of mean and covariance functions in defining a GP's behavior\n",
        "- Build and fit your first GP model using real data\n",

        "\n",
        "Throughout these notebooks, you'll notice sections marked with 🤖. These are **LLM-assisted exercises** where you'll practice using large language models (like ChatGPT, Claude, or your favorite coding assistant) to help you implement GP concepts. This approach reflects modern data science practice: knowing *what* you want to accomplish and *how* to verify it is often more important than memorizing every implementation detail.\n",
        "\n",
        "The exercises are designed to help you develop the skill of effectively communicating with AI assistants—a critical ability in today's data science workflow. You'll learn to write clear prompts, test implementations, and validate results, building both your GP expertise and your collaborative coding skills."

        "\n",
        "When we talk about Gaussian processes being \"non-parametric,\" we're not saying they have no parameters—that would be confusing! Instead, we mean that GPs don't assume a fixed functional form with a finite number of parameters. \n",
        "\n",
        "Think about it this way: in linear regression, you commit to a straight line (or hyperplane) defined by a slope and intercept. You're making a strong assumption about the shape of your function before seeing the data. With a GP, you're defining a *distribution over functions*. The data then tells you which functions from this distribution are most plausible.\n",
        "\n",
        "This flexibility makes GPs incredibly powerful for modeling complex, unknown relationships. The \"parameters\" in a GP are actually hyperparameters that control properties like smoothness and lengthscale—they shape the space of possible functions rather than defining a single function."

        "1. **Specify a probability model**: Assign probability distributions to all unknowns—parameters, predictions, even missing data\n",

        "At its heart, Bayesian inference is about updating beliefs with data. We start with prior knowledge (the prior), observe data (the likelihood), and combine them through multiplication to get updated knowledge (the posterior):\n",

        "- What we believe about $\\theta$ after seeing data is proportional to how likely the data would be under different $\\theta$ values, weighted by what we believed before\n",
        "\n",
        "This seemingly simple equation is incredibly powerful. Think of it visually: if your prior was a curve and the likelihood was another curve, the posterior is their product—peaks where both agree, valleys where they disagree.\n",
        "\n",
