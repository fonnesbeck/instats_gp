    "\n",
    "In Session 1, we built intuition about Gaussian processes by connecting multivariate normal distributions to functions. We learned that the **covariance function** (or kernel) is the heart of a GP—it encodes our assumptions about how similar function values should be at different input locations. We also saw how to build simple GP models in PyMC using `pm.gp.Marginal` with Gaussian noise.\n",

The ExpQuad kernel assumes the underlying function is extremely well-behaved. This is great for phenomena like temperature changes or other physical processes that vary continuously. However, it can be *too* smooth for many real-world applications, potentially over-smoothing genuine features in the data.\n",

The Matérn 5/2 is often the go-to choice in practice—it's smooth enough for most applications but doesn't impose unrealistic smoothness assumptions. Think of it as the \"Goldilocks\" kernel.\n",

    "So far, we've used Gaussian noise (in `pm.gp.Marginal`) or Bernoulli outcomes (in classification). But real data often contains **outliers**—observations that don't fit the typical pattern. Gaussian distributions are not robust to outliers: a single extreme value can dramatically affect inference.\n",

    "\n",
    "Everything we've done so far has a major limitation: computational cost. Exact GP inference is $O(n^3)$ in the number of data points, making it impractical for datasets with thousands of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Session 3, we'll tackle this head-on:\n",
    "- **Sparse GPs** with inducing points that approximate the full GP\n",
    "- **Hilbert Space GPs (HSGP)** that use basis function expansions\n",
    "- **Practical strategies** for choosing approximation parameters\n",
    "- **When approximations are (and aren't) appropriate**\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques will let you scale GPs to large datasets while maintaining the flexibility we've explored today. See you in Session 3!"
