    "# Session 1: Introduction to Gaussian Processes and PyMC\n",
    "\n",
    "**Duration:** 3 hours  \n",
    "**Workshop:** Gaussian Processes with PyMC and LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Processes (GPs) represent one of the most elegant and powerful tools in modern machine learning and statistics. Unlike parametric models that assume specific functional forms, GPs provide a **non-parametric approach** that can capture complex patterns while naturally quantifying uncertainty. This makes them particularly valuable for applications where understanding uncertainty is as important as making predictions—from scientific modeling to decision-making under uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "This session introduces the foundational concepts of Gaussian Processes within the PyMC probabilistic programming framework. We will build intuition about what it means for a process to be \"Gaussian,\" explore the mathematical machinery that makes GPs work, and learn to implement them using PyMC's powerful and expressive interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Gaussian Processes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional machine learning often focuses on finding the \"best\" parameters for a pre-specified model. Gaussian Processes take a fundamentally different approach: instead of assuming a specific functional form, they place a probability distribution directly over the **space of functions**. This perspective offers several compelling advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Principled uncertainty quantification**: GPs provide natural confidence intervals and probability distributions over predictions\n",
    "- **Automatic model selection**: Through marginal likelihood optimization, GPs can automatically tune their complexity to the data\n",
    "- **Incorporation of prior knowledge**: Domain expertise can be encoded through choice of mean functions and covariance kernels\n",
    "- **Small data efficiency**: GPs can make meaningful predictions and quantify uncertainty even with limited training data\n",
    "- **Interpretable hyperparameters**: Kernel parameters often have clear physical or domain-specific meanings\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this session, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand the mathematical foundations of GPs**: Grasp how Gaussian Processes extend multivariate Gaussian distributions to infinite-dimensional function spaces\n",
    "2. **Build intuition through visualization**: Create and interpret samples from GP priors to understand how hyperparameters affect function behavior\n",
    "3. **Master PyMC's probabilistic programming paradigm**: Use PyMC's model contexts, distributions, and inference machinery for GP modeling\n",
    "4. **Construct and analyze covariance functions**: Build kernels from first principles and understand their role in encoding assumptions about function smoothness and structure\n",
    "5. **Navigate PyMC's GP implementations**: Understand the trade-offs between `gp.Marginal` and `gp.Latent` approaches and when to use each\n",
    "6. **Apply GPs to real problems**: Build complete GP regression models, from prior specification through posterior inference to prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Session Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "This session is organized into six major sections, each building on the previous one:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mathematical Foundations** (45 minutes): Core concepts, definitions, and the connection between finite and infinite-dimensional Gaussians\n",
    "2. **PyMC Fundamentals** (45 minutes): Model contexts, distributions, random variables, and the probabilistic programming paradigm\n",
    "3. **Kernel Theory and Construction** (45 minutes): Understanding covariance functions as the heart of GP modeling\n",
    "4. **PyMC GP Implementations** (45 minutes): Comparing marginal vs. latent formulations with practical examples\n",
    "5. **Hands-on Practice** (30 minutes): Guided exercises to reinforce key concepts\n",
    "6. **Integration and Next Steps** (15 minutes): Synthesis and preview of advanced topics\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Univariate Gaussian**: $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ describes uncertainty about a single scalar value\n",
    "2. **Multivariate Gaussian**: $\\mathbf{X} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}, \\Sigma)$ describes uncertainty about a finite-dimensional vector\n",
    "3. **Gaussian Process**: $f(\\cdot) \\sim \\mathcal{GP}(m(\\cdot), k(\\cdot, \\cdot))$ describes uncertainty about an infinite-dimensional function\n",
    "\n",
    "The remarkable insight of Gaussian Processes is that we can work with infinite-dimensional function spaces by considering only finite-dimensional marginals at any collection of input points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formal Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: A Gaussian Process is a collection of random variables, any finite number of which have a joint Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, a stochastic process $\\{f(x) : x \\in \\mathcal{X}\\}$ is a Gaussian Process if for any finite set of indices $\\{x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\} \\subset \\mathcal{X}$, the joint distribution of the random vector $(f(x_1), f(x_2), \\ldots, f(x_n))^T$ is multivariate Gaussian.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Gaussian Process is completely specified by two functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean function**: $m(x) = \\mathbb{E}[f(x)]$\n",
    "2. **Covariance function**: $k(x, x') = \\mathbb{Cov}[f(x), f(x')] = \\mathbb{E}[(f(x) - m(x))(f(x') - m(x'))]$\n",
    "\n",
    "We denote this as:\n",
    "$$f(x) \\sim \\mathcal{GP}(m(x), k(x, x'))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Finite-Dimensional View\n",
    "\n",
    "For any finite collection of input points $\\mathbf{X} = \\{x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\}$, the corresponding function values $\\mathbf{f} = [f(x_1), f(x_2), \\ldots, f(x_n)]^T$ follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{f} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}, \\mathbf{K})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = [m(x_1), m(x_2), \\ldots, m(x_n)]^T$ is the mean vector\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{K}$ is the covariance matrix with entries $K_{ij} = k(x_i, x_j)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This finite-dimensional perspective is crucial because it allows us to:\n",
    "- Sample functions from the GP (by sampling from the multivariate Gaussian)\n",
    "- Compute likelihoods (using the multivariate Gaussian density)\n",
    "- Perform inference (using standard multivariate Gaussian conditioning)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of Covariance Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The covariance function $k(x, x')$ is the heart of a Gaussian Process. It encodes our assumptions about function smoothness, periodicity, and other structural properties. For $k$ to be a valid covariance function, it must be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Symmetric**: $k(x, x') = k(x', x)$ for all $x, x'$\n",
    "2. **Positive semi-definite**: For any finite set $\\{x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\}$, the matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ with $K_{ij} = k(x_i, x_j)$ must be positive semi-definite\n",
    "\n",
    "These conditions ensure that the resulting covariance matrices are valid, guaranteeing that we can sample from and compute probabilities under the GP."

    "## Summary: When to Use Which Approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our comprehensive comparison, here are the key decision criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use **Marginal GP** (`pm.gp.Marginal`) when:\n",
    "- ✅ **Gaussian likelihood**: You have regression with normal noise\n",
    "- ✅ **Computational efficiency**: Speed and memory are important\n",
    "- ✅ **Large datasets**: More than ~100-200 data points\n",
    "- ✅ **Standard regression**: Basic function interpolation/extrapolation\n",
    "- ✅ **Production deployment**: Need fast inference\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use **Latent GP** (`pm.gp.Latent`) when:\n",
    "- ✅ **Non-Gaussian likelihoods**: Classification, count data, robust regression\n",
    "- ✅ **Function access needed**: Want posterior samples of the function itself\n",
    "- ✅ **Complex models**: Hierarchical models, multi-output GPs\n",
    "- ✅ **Small datasets**: Fewer than ~100 data points\n",
    "- ✅ **Research/exploration**: Flexibility more important than speed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Performance**: Both approaches yield virtually identical predictions for Gaussian regression\n",
    "2. **Speed**: Marginal approach is typically 2-5x faster\n",
    "3. **Memory**: Marginal approach uses less memory (O(n²) vs O(n² + n))\n",
    "4. **Flexibility**: Latent approach works with any likelihood\n",
    "5. **Hyperparameters**: Both learn very similar hyperparameter values\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Start with Marginal GP** for standard regression problems\n",
    "- **Use informative priors** on hyperparameters when possible\n",
    "- **Check prior predictive samples** before fitting\n",
    "- **Monitor convergence** using effective sample size and R-hat\n",
    "- **Validate predictions** on held-out test data\n",

    "### Practice Exercises with LLM Assistance\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand the fundamentals, it's time to practice using **Large Language Models (LLMs) like those in VSCode/Cursor to assist with PyMC GP development**. These exercises are specifically designed to help you leverage AI coding assistants effectively for probabilistic programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **LLM-Assisted Kernel Experimentation**: Ask your LLM to help implement different kernels (Matérn, Periodic, combinations) and explain how they affect model behavior\n",
    "2. **Interactive Hyperparameter Analysis**: Use your LLM to create visualizations showing how different prior choices affect GP predictions\n",
    "3. **Real Data Application**: Have your LLM help you process and model a real dataset with appropriate GP specifications\n",
    "4. **Model Comparison**: Ask your LLM to implement and compare different GP formulations on the same problem\n",
