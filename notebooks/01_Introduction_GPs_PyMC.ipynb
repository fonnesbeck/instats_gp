    "# Session 1: Introduction to Gaussian Processes and PyMC\n",
    "\n",
    "**Duration:** 3 hours  \n",
    "**Workshop:** Gaussian Processes with PyMC and LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Processes (GPs) represent one of the most elegant and powerful tools in modern machine learning and statistics. Unlike parametric models that assume specific functional forms, GPs provide a **non-parametric approach** that can capture complex patterns while naturally quantifying uncertainty. This makes them particularly valuable for applications where understanding uncertainty is as important as making predictions—from scientific modeling to decision-making under uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "This session introduces the foundational concepts of Gaussian Processes within the PyMC probabilistic programming framework. We will build intuition about what it means for a process to be \"Gaussian,\" explore the mathematical machinery that makes GPs work, and learn to implement them using PyMC's powerful and expressive interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Gaussian Processes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional machine learning often focuses on finding the \"best\" parameters for a pre-specified model. Gaussian Processes take a fundamentally different approach: instead of assuming a specific functional form, they place a probability distribution directly over the **space of functions**. This perspective offers several compelling advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Principled uncertainty quantification**: GPs provide natural confidence intervals and probability distributions over predictions\n",
    "- **Automatic model selection**: Through marginal likelihood optimization, GPs can automatically tune their complexity to the data\n",
    "- **Incorporation of prior knowledge**: Domain expertise can be encoded through choice of mean functions and covariance kernels\n",
    "- **Small data efficiency**: GPs can make meaningful predictions and quantify uncertainty even with limited training data\n",
    "- **Interpretable hyperparameters**: Kernel parameters often have clear physical or domain-specific meanings\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this session, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand the mathematical foundations of GPs**: Grasp how Gaussian Processes extend multivariate Gaussian distributions to infinite-dimensional function spaces\n",
    "2. **Build intuition through visualization**: Create and interpret samples from GP priors to understand how hyperparameters affect function behavior\n",
    "3. **Master PyMC's probabilistic programming paradigm**: Use PyMC's model contexts, distributions, and inference machinery for GP modeling\n",
    "4. **Construct and analyze covariance functions**: Build kernels from first principles and understand their role in encoding assumptions about function smoothness and structure\n",
    "5. **Navigate PyMC's GP implementations**: Understand the trade-offs between `gp.Marginal` and `gp.Latent` approaches and when to use each\n",
    "6. **Apply GPs to real problems**: Build complete GP regression models, from prior specification through posterior inference to prediction\n",

    "## Part I: Mathematical Foundations of Gaussian Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand Gaussian Processes deeply, we must first establish their mathematical foundations. This section will build intuition by connecting familiar concepts (univariate and multivariate Gaussians) to the more abstract notion of distributions over functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### From Scalars to Functions: The Gaussian Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "The conceptual progression from simple to complex Gaussian structures provides the key to understanding GPs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Univariate Gaussian**: $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ describes uncertainty about a single scalar value\n",
    "2. **Multivariate Gaussian**: $\\mathbf{X} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}, \\Sigma)$ describes uncertainty about a finite-dimensional vector\n",
    "3. **Gaussian Process**: $f(\\cdot) \\sim \\mathcal{GP}(m(\\cdot), k(\\cdot, \\cdot))$ describes uncertainty about an infinite-dimensional function\n",
    "\n",
    "The remarkable insight of Gaussian Processes is that we can work with infinite-dimensional function spaces by considering only finite-dimensional marginals at any collection of input points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formal Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: A Gaussian Process is a collection of random variables, any finite number of which have a joint Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, a stochastic process $\\{f(x) : x \\in \\mathcal{X}\\}$ is a Gaussian Process if for any finite set of indices $\\{x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\} \\subset \\mathcal{X}$, the joint distribution of the random vector $(f(x_1), f(x_2), \\ldots, f(x_n))^T$ is multivariate Gaussian.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Gaussian Process is completely specified by two functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean function**: $m(x) = \\mathbb{E}[f(x)]$\n",
    "2. **Covariance function**: $k(x, x') = \\mathbb{Cov}[f(x), f(x')] = \\mathbb{E}[(f(x) - m(x))(f(x') - m(x'))]$\n",
    "\n",
    "We denote this as:\n",
    "$$f(x) \\sim \\mathcal{GP}(m(x), k(x, x'))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Finite-Dimensional View\n",
    "\n",
    "For any finite collection of input points $\\mathbf{X} = \\{x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\}$, the corresponding function values $\\mathbf{f} = [f(x_1), f(x_2), \\ldots, f(x_n)]^T$ follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{f} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}, \\mathbf{K})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = [m(x_1), m(x_2), \\ldots, m(x_n)]^T$ is the mean vector\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{K}$ is the covariance matrix with entries $K_{ij} = k(x_i, x_j)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This finite-dimensional perspective is crucial because it allows us to:\n",
    "- Sample functions from the GP (by sampling from the multivariate Gaussian)\n",
    "- Compute likelihoods (using the multivariate Gaussian density)\n",
    "- Perform inference (using standard multivariate Gaussian conditioning)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of Covariance Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The covariance function $k(x, x')$ is the heart of a Gaussian Process. It encodes our assumptions about function smoothness, periodicity, and other structural properties. For $k$ to be a valid covariance function, it must be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Symmetric**: $k(x, x') = k(x', x)$ for all $x, x'$\n",
    "2. **Positive semi-definite**: For any finite set $\\{x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\}$, the matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ with $K_{ij} = k(x_i, x_j)$ must be positive semi-definite\n",
    "\n",
    "These conditions ensure that the resulting covariance matrices are valid, guaranteeing that we can sample from and compute probabilities under the GP."

The RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernel, also called the Exponentiated Quadratic or Squared Exponential kernel, has two key hyperparameters:\n\n$$k(x, x') = \\sigma^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{||x - x'||^2}{2\\ell^2}\\right)$$\n\n- **Length scale ($\\ell$)**: Controls how quickly the correlation between function values decays with distance. Think of it as the \"characteristic wiggle width\"—smaller values produce rapidly varying functions, while larger values produce smoother functions.\n\n- **Variance ($\\sigma^2$)**: Controls the overall amplitude or vertical scale of functions. Larger variance allows functions to reach further from the mean.\n\nThe best way to understand these effects is not through abstract covariance matrices, but by looking at actual functions sampled from GP priors with different hyperparameter values. Let's visualize how each parameter shapes the kinds of functions the GP considers plausible."

This single hyperparameter essentially controls the \"smoothness\" or \"wiggliness\" of the functions:\n\n- **Short length scales** (ℓ = 0.5, 1.0) produce functions that can change rapidly over small distances. The GP believes that nearby points might have quite different function values, leading to oscillatory behavior.\n\n- **Long length scales** (ℓ = 2.0, 4.0) produce smooth, gradually varying functions. The GP believes that nearby points should have similar values, and it takes a substantial distance before the correlation decays significantly.\n\nThis parameter is often one of the most important to tune in GP applications. If your length scale is too short, the GP may overfit to noise; if it's too long, it may underfit and miss important variations in the data.\n\n### Effect of Variance Parameter\n\nNow let's examine how the variance (or amplitude) parameter $\\sigma^2$ affects GP priors.

Unlike length scale, which controls the texture and smoothness of functions, variance scales their overall magnitude. Notice that the *character* of the functions remains consistent across variance levels—wiggly functions stay wiggly, smooth functions stay smooth—but their amplitude changes dramatically.\n\n**Key Intuition**: Think of length scale as controlling the \"horizontal resolution\" (how quickly the function can change as you move along the x-axis) and variance as controlling the \"vertical resolution\" (how far the function can stray from the mean). Together, these two hyperparameters give you powerful control over the kinds of functions your GP prior considers plausible.\n\nIn practice, these hyperparameters are rarely set manually. Instead, we learn them from data through Bayesian inference, allowing the GP to automatically discover the appropriate smoothness and scale for the problem at hand. This is one of the key strengths of the Gaussian Process framework—it can adapt its complexity to match the data.\n\n---",

    "## Summary: When to Use Which Approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our comprehensive comparison, here are the key decision criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use **Marginal GP** (`pm.gp.Marginal`) when:\n",
    "- ✅ **Gaussian likelihood**: You have regression with normal noise\n",
    "- ✅ **Computational efficiency**: Speed and memory are important\n",
    "- ✅ **Large datasets**: More than ~100-200 data points\n",
    "- ✅ **Standard regression**: Basic function interpolation/extrapolation\n",
    "- ✅ **Production deployment**: Need fast inference\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use **Latent GP** (`pm.gp.Latent`) when:\n",
    "- ✅ **Non-Gaussian likelihoods**: Classification, count data, robust regression\n",
    "- ✅ **Function access needed**: Want posterior samples of the function itself\n",
    "- ✅ **Complex models**: Hierarchical models, multi-output GPs\n",
    "- ✅ **Small datasets**: Fewer than ~100 data points\n",
    "- ✅ **Research/exploration**: Flexibility more important than speed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Performance**: Both approaches yield virtually identical predictions for Gaussian regression\n",
    "2. **Speed**: Marginal approach is typically 2-5x faster\n",
    "3. **Memory**: Marginal approach uses less memory (O(n²) vs O(n² + n))\n",
    "4. **Flexibility**: Latent approach works with any likelihood\n",
    "5. **Hyperparameters**: Both learn very similar hyperparameter values\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Start with Marginal GP** for standard regression problems\n",
    "- **Use informative priors** on hyperparameters when possible\n",
    "- **Check prior predictive samples** before fitting\n",
    "- **Monitor convergence** using effective sample size and R-hat\n",
    "- **Validate predictions** on held-out test data\n",

These exercises are specifically designed to help you leverage AI coding assistants effectively for probabilistic programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **LLM-Assisted Kernel Experimentation**: Ask your LLM to help implement different kernels (Matérn, Periodic, combinations) and explain how they affect model behavior\n",
    "2. **Interactive Hyperparameter Analysis**: Use your LLM to create visualizations showing how different prior choices affect GP predictions\n",
    "3. **Real Data Application**: Have your LLM help you process and model a real dataset with appropriate GP specifications\n",
